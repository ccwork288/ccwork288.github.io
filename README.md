### Tic-Tac-Toe

This directory contains a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring both single-player (vs. AI) and two-player (human vs. human) modes.

#### How to Play Locally:

1.  Navigate to the `game_experiments/tic-tac-toe/` directory.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
    (e.g., `file:///<GITHUB_HOME>/ccwork288.github.io/game_experiments/tic-tac-toe/index.html`)
3.  On the initial screen, select either 'Single Player' to play against the computer or 'Two Players' for a human vs. human game.
4.  Players can take turns clicking on the squares to place their marks (X or O). You can change the mode at any time during the game.
